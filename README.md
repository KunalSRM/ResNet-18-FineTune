# Fine-Tuned ResNet-18 for Image Classification

This repository contains a **Jupyter notebook** demonstrating fine-tuning of **ResNet-18** for image classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers:  
- Loading a pre-trained ResNet-18 model  
- Fine-tuning on a custom dataset  
- Training and evaluation  
- Grad-CAM visualizations to interpret model predictions  

The project is aimed at showcasing practical applications of **transfer learning** in computer vision.
